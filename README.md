# Surfs_Up - Module 9 Challenge

## Overview
The goal with project is to analyze weather data for Hawaii to determine if a surf/ice cream shop has a good enough climate to serve ice cream yearly. The database that is provided contains temperature and precipitation data. This data will be accessed using SQLAchemy and Panda to display it without the need of using an SQL database like PGAdmin. To properly display the data, we created an API using Flask to display the data on a webpage. 

## Results 

- The following table shows the statistical parameters for the temperature in the months of June & December.

Based on this table:
* December is, on average, 3.9 degrees colder than June.
* The difference between the coldest day in June and the coldest day in December is 8 degrees.
* The hottest day in June is only two degrees warmer than in December. 

## Summary
Although the mean temperature is lower in December than it is in June, it is not significant. Therefore, both months roughly the same temperature. Based on this alone, it is safe to assume the ice cream shop would do well if open all year.
